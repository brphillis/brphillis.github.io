                     <p><u> Unlock the Multiverse with 'Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness' Featurette
                     </p></u><br>
                     <p> Are you ready to unlock the Multiverse? In a brand-new featurette, above, titular star Benedict Cumberbatch, who plays Doctor Strange, shares, "It's pretty unfathomably exciting where we're going in this film. It's the most fantastic new phase of Marvel."
                      Elizabeth Olsen, who plays the powerful Scarlet Witch, notes, "In this story, we are leaping into different universes. But unlocking the Multiverse creates a big Pandora's box."
                      Excited about what's in store, Benedict Wong, who plays the Sorcerer Supreme Wong, states, "We're in unknown territory. I think audiences are going to be startled. These other realities invite a plethora of all these new characters."
                     </p><br>
                     <p> "Telling this story was such a gigantic endeavor," reveals director Sam Raimi. "It had to be large because it had to not only paint a picture of our universe, but of multiple universes. It was a great opportunity to pair two of the most powerful Super Heroes together."
                     "It's got a sort of darker tone to it," states Cumberbatch, "and with Sam Raimi at the helm, you know he's a master of that."
                     Raimi adds, "We wanted the fans to go, 'Oh, how cool!' I mean that really was our goal. We wanted to give the fans what they wanted, just not exactly what they expected."
